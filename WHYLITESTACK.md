# Why Litestack?

If you're developing a Ruby web application, you may be wondering which database, caching, and job queueing solution is right for you. While there are many options out there, Litestack stands out as a top choice for its performance benefits, ease of setup and administration, resource efficiency, and potential cost savings.

## Standing on the shoulder of a (figurative) giant!
At its core, Litestack is built on top of SQLite, a highly regarded open-source relational database engine. This means that Litestack is highly efficient and resource-friendly, making it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized web applications. Additionally, because SQLite is a file-based database, it is incredibly easy to set up and manage, requiring no separate server installation or configuration.

## Performance and Efficiency
One of the most significant advantages of Litestack is its performance benefits. SQLite has a small memory footprint and is highly optimized, meaning that it can deliver fast and reliable database access. Additionally, Litestack's job queueing and caching functionality provide additional performance benefits, enabling you to execute tasks asynchronously and store frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.

## Dead simple Rails integration
In addition to its performance benefits and ease of administration, Litestack also offers a remarkably simple setup process for Ruby on Rails applications. With just a single gem install and three lines of configuration changes, you can have a fully functional database, caching, and job queueing solution up and running in no time.

## Simple by design
This ease of setup and configuration is due to Litestack's design philosophy, which prioritizes simplicity and ease of use. Rather than requiring developers to make significant code changes or configure complex infrastructure, Litestack offers a turnkey solution that can be set up with minimal effort.

This simplicity is a significant advantage for developers, as it allows them to focus on writing code and delivering features rather than dealing with the complexities of database and infrastructure management. By simplifying the setup process, Litestack can help reduce the time and cost required to get your application up and running, enabling you to focus on delivering value to your users.

That's not to say we hate on complex solutions, actually, we believe complexity has its place, elsewhere!.

## Simple can be cutting edge
Another benefit of Litestack is its deep integration with state of the art Ruby IO libraries like Async and Polyphony. This allows for even greater performance improvements and improved efficiency, as these libraries can help manage concurrency and parallelism in your web application.

## DevOps? Think DevNops!
Because Litestack is easy to set up and maintain, it can potentially reduce development costs and time to market. With fewer dependencies and simpler configuration requirements, developers can focus on writing code and delivering features rather than worrying about complex infrastructure and administration.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable, performant, and easy-to-use database, caching, and job queueing solution for your Ruby or Rails web application, Litestack is an excellent choice. With its built-in integration with SQLite and major IO libraries, Litestack can provide significant performance benefits while also reducing development costs and time to market.
